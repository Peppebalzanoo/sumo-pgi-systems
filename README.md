In recent years, the improvement of global living standards, rapid economic growth, and accelerated urbanization have led cities worldwide to experience a dramatic increase in the number of automobiles and a substantial growth in parking demand.

The high demand for parking has become a serious problem in both developed and developing countries. Many cities suffer from a severe shortage of parking spaces, and the imbalance between demand, i.e., the number of cars needing parking, and supply, i.e., the number of available parking spaces, is constantly on the rise.

Often, transportation systems fail to provide regular, safe, and adequate services. As a result, people increasingly prefer to purchase and own cars because they offer an unmatched combination of speed, autonomy, and privacy. However, the reality is that private cars are not in constant motion. These vehicles spend most of their time stationary in parking lots, such as during working hours and overnight.

Modern technology has produced a variety of new solutions and techniques that can help alleviate the problem by providing intelligent parking systems. These systems play a key role in urban traffic, and their absence is closely related to traffic congestion, road accidents, and environmental pollution.

These intelligent parking systems are known as Parking Guidance and Information Systems (PGI Systems). Installing and maintaining a Parking Guidance and Information System can be quite expensive. Therefore, it is essential to conduct simulations that utilize such systems for cost-benefit evaluations.

The following study will analyze different parking strategies, such as informed, partially informed, and uninformed strategies. For each of these strategies, various scenarios with varying parking capacity will be examined. The map used for simulations and strategy presentations will be that of San Francisco, also known as "The Golden City."

The objective of this study is to quantify the benefits of using Parking Guidance and Information Systems through micro-simulations of urban mobility using the SUMO simulator.

## Parking Guidance and Information Systems
Parking Guidance and Information Systems (PGI Systems) constitute a special class of intelligent transportation systems supported by information about the state of parking facilities.

Parking Guidance and Information Systems combine traffic monitoring, communication, processing, and signage technologies to provide drivers with dynamic information about parking within controlled areas.

These systems are designed to assist in finding available parking spaces by directing drivers to areas with low occupancy rates. Furthermore, they contribute to the development of a safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation network.

Over the years, PGI Systems have evolved significantly, increasingly becoming a combination of cutting-edge technologies and components. In general, a PGI System typically consists of four fundamental components:

  1. Parking Monitoring Mechanism: This component involves the use of sensors and monitoring equipment to track the occupancy and availability of parking spaces within a designated area.

  2. Parking Information Dissemination Mechanism: This component is responsible for communicating real-time parking information to drivers, often through various means such as roadside signs, mobile apps, or other digital platforms.

  3. Telecommunications Network: PGI Systems rely on a robust telecommunications network to transmit data and information between the monitoring systems, information dissemination mechanisms, and the central control center. This network enables the real-time exchange of data critical for parking guidance.

  4. Control Center: The central control center serves as the nerve center of the PGI System. It collects and processes data from the monitoring mechanisms, manages the dissemination of parking information, and coordinates the overall operation of the system. The control center plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the PGI System functions effectively and efficiently.

These four components work together to create a comprehensive and intelligent parking guidance and information system, offering drivers valuable real-time information to help them locate available parking spaces while optimizing the use of parking resources within a city or controlled area.
