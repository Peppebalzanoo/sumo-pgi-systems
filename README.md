In recent years, the improvement of global living standards, rapid economic growth, and accelerated urbanization have led cities worldwide to experience a dramatic increase in the number of automobiles and a substantial growth in parking demand.

The high demand for parking has become a serious problem in both developed and developing countries. Many cities suffer from a severe shortage of parking spaces, and the imbalance between demand, i.e., the number of cars needing parking, and supply, i.e., the number of available parking spaces, is constantly on the rise.

Often, transportation systems fail to provide regular, safe, and adequate services. As a result, people increasingly prefer to purchase and own cars because they offer an unmatched combination of speed, autonomy, and privacy. However, the reality is that private cars are not in constant motion. These vehicles spend most of their time stationary in parking lots, such as during working hours and overnight.

Modern technology has produced a variety of new solutions and techniques that can help alleviate the problem by providing intelligent parking systems. These systems play a key role in urban traffic, and their absence is closely related to traffic congestion, road accidents, and environmental pollution.

These intelligent parking systems are known as Parking Guidance and Information Systems (PGI Systems). Installing and maintaining a Parking Guidance and Information System can be quite expensive. Therefore, it is essential to conduct simulations that utilize such systems for cost-benefit evaluations.

## Objectives of this study
The following study will analyze different parking strategies, such as informed, partially informed, and uninformed strategies. For each of these strategies, various scenarios with varying parking capacity will be examined. The map used for simulations and strategy presentations will be that of San Francisco, also known as "The Golden City."

The objective of this study is to quantify the benefits of using Parking Guidance and Information Systems through micro-simulations of urban mobility using the SUMO simulator.

Installing and maintaining a Parking Guidance and Information System is highly resource-intensive in terms of finances. The question that the following study aims to answer is, "Is it really worth using Parking Guidance and Information Systems?"

The primary objective of this study is to address this question, but before doing so, it is essential to conduct simulations using advanced systems like SUMO to evaluate costs and benefits.

The simulations will encompass various parking strategies with varying information availability (uninformed, statically informed, and dynamically informed). For each of these, different scenarios will be analyzed to increase competition among drivers searching for parking. Finally, through the outputs generated by the simulations, it will be possible to quantify the benefits and proceed with cost assessment.

### Parking Guidance and Information Systems
Parking Guidance and Information Systems (PGI Systems) constitute a special class of intelligent transportation systems supported by information about the state of parking facilities.

Parking Guidance and Information Systems combine traffic monitoring, communication, processing, and signage technologies to provide drivers with dynamic information about parking within controlled areas.

These systems are designed to assist in finding available parking spaces by directing drivers to areas with low occupancy rates. Furthermore, they contribute to the development of a safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation network.

Over the years, PGI Systems have evolved significantly, increasingly becoming a combination of cutting-edge technologies and components. In general, a PGI System typically consists of four fundamental components:

  1. Parking Monitoring Mechanism: This component involves the use of sensors and monitoring equipment to track the occupancy and availability of parking spaces within a designated area

  2. Parking Information Dissemination Mechanism: This component is responsible for communicating real-time parking information to drivers, often through various means such as roadside signs, mobile apps, or other digital platforms

  3. Telecommunications Network: PGI Systems rely on a robust telecommunications network to transmit data and information between the monitoring systems, information dissemination mechanisms, and the central control center. This network enables the real-time exchange of data critical for parking guidance

  4. Control Center: The central control center serves as the nerve center of the PGI System. It collects and processes data from the monitoring mechanisms, manages the dissemination of parking information, and coordinates the overall operation of the system. The control center plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the PGI System functions effectively and efficiently

These four components work together to create a comprehensive and intelligent parking guidance and information system, offering drivers valuable real-time information to help them locate available parking spaces while optimizing the use of parking resources within a city or controlled area

A PGI System offers multiple benefits; however, their widespread adoption is limited by both the installation and maintenance costs of the system and the challenge of collecting detailed information. Numerous studies assert that the use of PGI Systems significantly increases the likelihood of finding available parking spaces, while search times have been drastically reduced.

PGI Systems play a key role in urban traffic, and their absence is closely related to traffic congestion, road accidents, and environmental pollution. Among other benefits, they include a reduction in the time and fuel spent searching for parking and a decrease in competitiveness among drivers.

The new technologies used ensure the provision of useful services such as locating a vehicle within a specific parking area in case of loss or an accident, and advance booking of available parking spaces through applications.

### Simulation of Urban MObility 
Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) is a free, open-source, highly portable, and multimodal traffic simulation suite designed to model large-scale transportation networks and systems
  1. Portable: It is available on a variety of platforms (Windows, Linux, or macOS) as it is implemented in C++/Python and uses portable libraries
  2. Microscopic Simulations: It simulates the movement of every single object by explicitly modeling all vehicles, pedestrians, and public transportation
  3. Multimodal: It combines various modes of transportation and simulates cars, buses, trains, bicycles, pedestrians, public transportation, and more

The primary reason for developing a suite for microscopic road traffic simulation (especially open-source) was to support the research community by providing them with a tool to implement and evaluate their algorithms.

SUMO includes a multitude of supporting tools that help automate the primary tasks involved in creating, running, and evaluating simulations. Furthermore, it offers various APIs for remote simulation control.

## Strategy 1
This strategy does not utilize any type of PGI Systems. In other words, vehicle drivers have no information regarding the location, capacity, availability, and distance from parking areas within their "search area," and upon arrival, they will randomly choose streets to navigate in search of an available parking spot.

Once the vehicle reaches its destination, the operation of the strategy is as follows:

  1. It checks if there is parking available on the destination street, and if so, it parks. After the parking stop, it will return to its starting street
  2. In case there are no available parking spots, a time limit is assigned to the vehicle to find parking. During this time, it will randomly roam within its "search area 1," with a side length of 500 meters
  3. If the assigned time limit for finding parking expires or if the vehicle reaches a point where it can do nothing but exit "search area 1," the time limit is reset, and "search area 2" is delineated, with a side length of 1000 meters, within which the vehicle will continue to roam randomly in search of parking
  4. If the time limit for finding parking expires or if the vehicle reaches a point where it can only exit "search area 2," the time limit is reset again, and "search area 3" is delineated, with a side length of 2000 meters, within which the vehicle will continue to roam randomly in search of parking
  5. If the time limit for finding parking expires or if the vehicle reaches a point where it can only exit "search area 3," the vehicle will be directed back to its starting street

The time limit assigned to the vehicle for finding an available parking spot is 10 minutes (600 seconds â‰ˆ 600 simulation steps). The duration of the parking stop is generated randomly, ranging from 10 minutes to 3 hours.

## Strategy 2
This strategy uses PGI Systems that provide static information. In other words, vehicle drivers will be directed to parking lots with the largest physical capacity within their "search area."

Once the vehicle reaches its destination, the operation of the strategy is as follows:
  1. It checks if there is parking available on the destination street, and if so, it parks. After the parking stop, it will return to its starting street
  2. In case there are no available parking spots, the strategy calculates the set of parking lots within the vehicle's "search area," ordered by physical capacity. The vehicle will be assigned the street with the largest parking lot as its destination
  3. If the vehicle, upon reaching its destination, still cannot find an available spot, it will be assigned the street with the next largest parking lot as its new destination (and so on...).
  4. If a vehicle has no parking lots physically located within its "search area," a larger "search area" will be considered, such as "search area 2" with a side length of 1000 meters, and in the event of further unavailability, "search area 3" with a side length of 2000 meters

There is no longer a concept of a time limit, and the duration of the parking stop, like in the Uninformed Strategy, is generated randomly, ranging from 10 minutes to 3 hours.

## Strategy 3
This strategy utilizes PGI Systems that provide dynamic information. In other words, vehicle drivers will be directed to parking lots with the largest availability of free spaces within their "search area."

Once the vehicle reaches its destination, the operation of the strategy is as follows:
  1. It checks if there is parking available on the destination street, and if so, it parks. After the parking stop, it will return to its starting street
  2. In case there are no available parking spots, the strategy calculates the set of parking lots within the vehicle's "search area" and orders them by the availability of free spaces. The vehicle will be assigned the street with the parking lot offering the most free spaces as its destination
  3. If the vehicle, upon reaching its destination, still cannot find an available spot, the set of parking lots ordered by free space availability will be recalculated. The vehicle will be assigned the street with the parking lot offering the most free spaces as its new destination
  4. If a vehicle has no parking lots physically located within its "search area," a larger "search area" will be considered, such as "search area 2" with a side length of 1000 meters, and in the event of further unavailability, "search area 3" with a side length of 2000 meters

There is no longer a concept of a time limit, and the duration of the parking stop, like in the Static Information Strategy, is generated randomly, ranging from 10 minutes to 3 hours.

At this point, there is nothing left but to draw the final conclusions. It can be easily inferred that there have been substantial differences among the three considered strategies.

In particular, the strategy that proved to be the best, yielding more advantageous results, is the "Dynamic Information Strategy" (Strategy 3). The strategy that, on the other hand, obtained the poorest results is the "Uninformed Strategy" (Strategy 1).

Furthermore, the "Static Information Strategy" (Strategy 2) achieved results very similar to the best strategy but, in any case, consistently less advantageous
